      How white, wealthy schools are dragging down vaccination percentages in California
 In 2014, a national measles outbreak was traced to  Disneyland, where at least 39 cases were traced to direct exposure at the park. Over 170 people in 21 states became infected. In California, 88% of the measles patients were either unvaccinated or had unknown or undocumented vaccination status. This caused the largest US measles outbreak in decades, with 667 confirmed cases.
<br /> Other outbreaks have appeared in Arizona, Texas, New York,  Washington, and Minnesota, all of which attributed to unvaccinated children and low vaccination rates in the respective areas. Other preventable diseases, such as whooping cough and Mumps, have also had outbreaks in poorly vaccinated communities.
<br /> While immunization is the clear answer to eliminating contagious diseases, there have been groups resisting vaccines for years. People have a variety of reasons for not vaccinating their children, but all philosophical and religious reasons fall into a category of vaccine exemptions called “Personal Belief Exemption.” A study of California kindergarteners caught to figure out not why people aren’t vaccinating, but who isn’t vaccinating. The results revealed a significant relationships between wealth and vaccination rates as well as race and vaccination rates.
